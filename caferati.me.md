## Summary

## Strength
- I enjoy the portfolio layout, spliting portfolio projects and spare time projects to two sparate pages
- Keeping the projects listed by image buttons, with a descriptive titles keeps ages short and fully of useful info
- The introduction game is very fun
- The filters for the project pages are very useful for highlighting specific skills

## Improvements
- The only change I would make would be to remove / condense some of the projects
- The code laboratory projects with the banner of coding feel more like a blog post then what I was expecting
- The show hidden files on macOS while interesting feel like it should be towards the bottom of the page it's on

## Best fit
- They show they are very experienced as well as a fun person
- Web Development
- Web Developer
- I see them being a very fun person who can get along well with a team

## General considerations
- This is a very strong portfolio, I see why you've won your award
